# User Group Proposal Process

## Introduction

This document outlines the application process for creating a user group (UG).

## Forming a UG

UGs may be formed by a group of ICON Community members or by the steering committee. The steering committee approves the formation of each UG and periodically reviews the activity of all UGs to ensure they are fulfilling their mission.

Each ICON UG must draft a charter following the [charter template](charter-template.md) that defines its scope, deliverables, timeline, governance, and communication methods.

The UG's charter should be submitted as a pull request that will be approved or rejected by the steering committee members.
