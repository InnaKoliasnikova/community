## Successes

| Success | Notes |

| Successfully built product | Target was NFT collection in ICON ecosystem. Gangstabet is now a well-known and respected NFT project in the ICON ecosystem |

## Failures

| Failures | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Community development and collaboration | By no means a failure, as the community has been consistent. However, from the perspective of creating partnerships based around the Gangstabet brand, there is room for improvement. It would be good to see more NFTs used as profile pictures or brand assets from other groups |

## Challenges

| Challenges | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| How to create better collaborations | The project maintains its status in the ICON ecosystem with solid development and delivery. What are the ways that the project can grow into more than an isolated game? |

## Solutions

| Solutions | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Marketing and community management | Users and collaborating organizations may like to see more engagement from personalities involved with the Gangstabet project. People like to follow the stories of involved parties so that they can feel as if they are growing together |


## Path Forward

| Path Forward | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Look for someone to do interpersonal community management | This exists in some ways through the Discord, but there is not as much engagement as there could be. Working with a community manager that keeps the story going and keeps everyone engaged to promote each other's endeavors is a great way to create a more useful and enjoyable product |
