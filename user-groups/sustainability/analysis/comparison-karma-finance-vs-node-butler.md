## Decision-making process

### Weighted Decision Matrix

A [weighted decision matrix](https://airfocus.com/blog/weighted-decision-matrix-prioritization/) is a form of [payoff matrix](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PayoffMatrix.html) for determining optimal decision strategies. It comes from ideas in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
