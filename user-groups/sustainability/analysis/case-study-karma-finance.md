## Successes

| Success | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Successfully built product | Target was Icon DeFi and NFT(fi) protocols (OMM, Balanced, Optimus, Craft, Inanis Invictus, ..). Successfully provided bonds for OMM, Inanis Invictus and Balanced |

## Failures

| Failures | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Marketing | Currently in stand still because of active development of Convexus and resourcefully connected Equality project as well as revision plan making where sustainable business model is being created for Karma Bond |
| Late delivery | Took an extra month or so for delivery. On-time delivery is always preferable |

## Challenges

| Challenges | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| How to connect to more businesses | 100% dependency on the will of other protocols (bond providers). Protocols seeking to raise their own POL without using Karma Bond in order to avoid paying fees for the service (e.g. Balanced is going to deploy their own bond rather than using Karma Bond) |
| Sustainable revenue | Currently team is not making any (little to none) money |

## Solutions

| Solutions | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Better community building and user engagement | Stunted growth may benefit from more effort into community building and user engagement efforts |
| Fewer dependencies on business customers | Provide products and services for users without external dependency on the will of other protocols. From a high level, must establish sustainable income revenue flows  which will cover the costs of development, marketing, management and further growth of the product |


## Path Forward

| Path Forward | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Look for communication-based partnerships | Recommend to partner with projects that keep users highly engaged, for example artist / storytelling / media production communities. This can be a useful way to co-market a product |
