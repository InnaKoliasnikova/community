## Decision-making process

### Weighted Decision Matrix

A [weighted decision matrix](https://airfocus.com/blog/weighted-decision-matrix-prioritization/) is a form of [payoff matrix](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PayoffMatrix.html) for determining optimal decision strategies. It comes from ideas in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)



| Criteria                | Criteria Weight | Agora | Gangstabet |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Impact on the Ecosystem | 5               | 4             | 5           |
| Feasibility             | 5               | 5             | 5           |
| Cost                    | 5               | 5             | 3           |
| Timeframe               | 3               | 5             | 5           |
| Innovation              | 2               | 4             | 3           |
| Total Score             | \---           | 93            | 86          |

---
**From this process, we see that Agora is more valuable, then Gangstabet. The total possible score is 100. By heuristically stating that any project over 65 has value, both projects are shown to have value**
