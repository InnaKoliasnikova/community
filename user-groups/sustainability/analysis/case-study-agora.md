## Successes

| Success | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Successfully built product | Target was DAOs in ICON community. Currently in-use by popular teams in ICON ecosystem, including Balanced, Craft, and Gangstabet. Also planned to be used by other projects, including by Protokol 7 projects |

## Failures

| Failures | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Ease of use | Ideally, new DAOs would be deployable with a single click. Currently, it still requires manual intervention. Additionally, documentation could be improved to minimize direct interaction with the development team |

## Challenges

| Challenges | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| How to connect to more businesses | Useful product, but limited reach currently. This is in part due to low marketing and the relatively small ICON ecosystem |
| Sustainable revenue | Currently team is not making any (little to none) money from this product |

## Solutions

| Solutions | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| More marketing | This product is pretty easily marketable to organizations outside of the existing ICON ecosystem. It should be developed and marketed as such |
| Establish cross-chain product | Creating an efficient cross-chain system for DAO infrastructure would be helpful to the overall web3 ecosystem |


## Path Forward

| Path Forward | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| Market and develop outside of direct ICON ecosystem | Recommend to establish more partnerships and marketing outside of the direct ICON ecosystem. This product is applicable for general DAO infrastructure and should be treated as such. The biggest roadblock is that it is not yet cross-chain |
