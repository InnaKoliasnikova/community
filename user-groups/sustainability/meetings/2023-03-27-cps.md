### Project Analysis

*Goal: Analyze 2-3 projects per months for better understanding of performance and expectations*

- [Single-project analysis template](https://github.com/icon-project/grants-program/blob/main/templates/yymmdd-single-project-analysis.md)
- [Project options analysis template](https://github.com/icon-project/grants-program/blob/main/templates/yymmdd-project-options-analysis.md)

**Projects for this month**

- TBD...

### Protocol upgrade proposals
*Goal: Introduce improvements to the CPS that can make an immediate difference*

**Mandatory progress report sections**

*The main purpose of a mandatory progress report section is to increase accountability of project teams, better be able to predict future behavior of development teams, and better be able to plan for future voting decisions of CPS voters*

- 'Deliverables Accomplished This Cycle' should be necessary to show that work was accomplished or not so that the community can understand the state of the project
- 'Projected for next cycle' should be necessary to let the community know what to expect from the project team during the next cycle. This aids with planning for related projects and aids understanding about whether the team was able to accomplish the stated milestones in the stated timeframe

**Payment per milestone**

*The main purpose of payment per milestone is to increase accountability of project teams and incentivize follow-through on projects*

- Majority or total payment on delivery. Possibility for small percentage up-front
- Validation of delivery decided by CPS voters

**Domain-specific funding buckets**

*The main purpose of domain-specific funding buckets is to give attention to important aspects of ecosystem development that deserve more focused funding*

- Bucket categories: 'open technology' (15%, 6 month accumulation), 'media' (15% 4 month accumulation), 'general' (70% 1 month accumulation as before)
- The idea of the given percentages is to ensure that the majority functionality of the CPS is the same as before. However, we can now test out giving domain-specific projects more focused attention as a way to manage ecosystem growth per domain
- The idea of the given accumulation periods is to ensure that there is enough funding for open technology and marketing projects, given the size of the projects that we expect to be proposed
- Open technology projects may be viable for longer contracts and more substantial development teams as we project at this time, so they have an accumulation period of 15%, which over 6 months yields approximately 95% of the full monthly CPS budget
- Media projects may be viable for shorter term contracts, such as running a single event or producing a series of smaller marketing endeavors. Over 4 months, this bucket yields approximately 40% of the full monthly CPS budget
- Teams may look to utilize all funding buckets, but should note that their proposals should be judged accordingly and should be cautioned against complex forms of funding coordination reliant on multiple proposals passing
