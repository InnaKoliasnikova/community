### Protocol upgrades and discussions

*Goal: Introduce improvements to the CPS that can make an immediate difference. Also form a longer-term plan for improvements that are important, but more complex or not immediately high priority*

**Upcoming CPS developments**

*As of now, this is still in review, but is what is planned*

- Payout based on delivery of milestones
- Variables tunable by governance
- Frontend upgrades

**Committee-based vs validator-based decision-making**

*This would not be implemented immediately, but once we sufficiently discuss an implementation plan can be created*

- Should CPS governance change to be committee-based instead of validator-based or something else. This is a high priority to discuss

**CPS-funded project code ownership and accountability**

*Last time, we mostly seemed to agree that full, required code-ownership is not beneficial. However, maybe there's some medium*

- Should code be owned by CPS in some cases? Currently some projects leave after being funded, and there's nothing to show even if it were delivered
- Note that exclusivity agreements may not be competitive
- Open-source is a good medium, and maybe worth looking to generate more interest in open-source deliverables for continued, decentralized development

**Revenue return**

*This is a longer-term idea that would mostly be relevant if there were a larger funding pool or a venture-arm of the CPS*

- If there were KYC agreements for funding, it may be good to have revenue percentages go back to the CPS if the project is reaches certain amount of success
- Long-off goal, but worth noting
