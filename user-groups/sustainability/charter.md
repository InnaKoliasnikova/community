This charter adheres to the [SIG governance guidelines](/guidelines/governance/sig-governance-guidelines.md).

## Overview

Establishing and maintaining healthy communication and participation patterns for businesses of all types within the ICON ecosystem is an important part of the process of sustainability and growth. We aim to promote business scales from sole-proprietors to large-scale corporations, as well as domains from artists to infrastructure providers. Examples of this facilitation include: 

- Discussing and documenting monetization strategies
- Providing clear and accessible communication channels for introductions and discussions
- Performing case studies on business practices
- Noting and registering open niches within the ecosystem
- Developing open funding sources, such as the [Contribution Proposal System](cps.icon.community), and providing the blueprints to establish further, derivative funding sources

This includes collaborations with SIG Contributor Experience for programs such as jobs portals.

## Scope

The Sustainability User Group (UG) is responsible for improving the experience of those who want to participate in a sustainable way in the ICON ecosystem. We do this by creating and maintaining programs and processes that promote monetarily and socially sustainable participation practices, while retiring those programs and processes that don't. Being conscientious of the feasibility of sustainable participation within our ecosystem is critical to scaling the project, growing the ecosystem, and helping the project succeed.

We aim to promote both competition and collaboration. We recognize that there are benefits to both idealogical approaches, with the base principle to be held that open communication is to everybody's benefit.
