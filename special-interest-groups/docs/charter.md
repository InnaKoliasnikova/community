## Overview

Responsibility for creating feature documentation belongs to the developers and SIGs creating each feature. This includes task-driven documentation for the feature itself and conceptual documentation about the feature.

## Scope

SIG Docs publishes ICON project documentation on docs.icon.community. ICON project documentation includes:

- Documentation of the core ICON blockchain, including economic and technical specifications
- Core ICON APIs
- ICON execution environment tools, including for compilation and testing

Responsibility for creating feature documentation belongs to the developers and SIGs creating each feature. This includes task-driven documentation for the feature itself and conceptual documentation about the feature.

SIG Docs sets standards for feature documentation, provides clear paths for docs contribution, and coordinates documentation updates during quarterly releases.

SIG Docs creates subprojects as needed to handle specific aspects of ICON project documentation.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

The docs.icon.community website, which includes:

- Site content and documentation
- Content style guides and their application to feature documentation and release notes
- Processes for launching feature content and release notes during releases
- Reference documentation for:
  - The core ICON blockchain, including economic and technical specifications
  - The core ICON APIs, including core derivative SDKs
  - The core ICON execution environment tools, including for compilation and testing

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- Standards for content: style guide, contributor guide, PR reviews SIG Docs is not responsible for branding any content related to the ICON project organization. We are sometimes informally invited to consult on branding and design decisions, but we have no formal responsibility for such work.
- Coordinating docs contributions for releases
- Other project documentation: SIG Docs is sometimes advises on ICON project components outside of the icon-project Github organization, the icon-community Github organization, or on other ICON subprojects, but is not responsible for the documentation of any of these components or projects

### Out of scope

- SIG Docs is not responsible for creating new feature documentation
- SIG Docs reviews and coordinates feature documentation created by community members
- SIG Docs sets standards for content creation, in the form of a style guide; offers feedback and review of new feature documentation; offers advice about information architecture for new features in the docs; and otherwise provides guidance and oversight to make sure that new feature documentation is maximally helpful to developers.
- Branding, logos, or brand style guides for the ICON project
