| **Sponsor**   | Eric Solomon (eric@icon.foundation) |
| **Updated**   | 18 October 2022 |

This charter adheres to the [SIG governance guidelines](/guidelines/governance/sig-governance-guidelines.md).

## Overview

Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem. We need to ensure our contributors are happy and productive, and that there are not bottlenecks hindering the project in, for example: feature velocity, community scaling, pull request latency, and absolute numbers of open pull requests and open issues.

## Scope
The [Contributor Experience Special Interest Group](./) (SIG) is responsible for improving the experience of those who contribute to the ICON ecosystem. We do this by creating, and maintaining programs and processes that promote community health and reduce project friction, while retiring those programs and processes that don't. Being conscientious of our contributor base is critical to scaling the project, growing the ecosystem, and helping the project succeed.

We do this by listening - whether it’s through our community events to SIG meetings, surveys, data, or [GitHub issues], we take in the feedback and turn it into our [project list]. We build a welcoming and inclusive community of contributors by giving them places to be heard and productive.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

- Establish policies, standards and procedures for the use, moderation, and management of all public platforms officially used by the project, as related to the contributor community, including but not limited to:
  - [forum.icon.community](https://forum.icon.community)
  - [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm)
  - [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7Z_1sTKN-kCVgFD2a0GXQ)
  - [Github](https://github.com/icon-project)
- Establish and staff teams responsible for the administration and moderation of these platforms
  - Teams must be staffed by trusted contributors spanning time zones, see moderation for more detail
  - They are authorized to take immediate action when dealing with code of conduct issues
  - They are expected to escalate to the project's code of conduct committee when issues rise above the level of simple moderation
- Work with other SIGs and interested parties in the project to execute GitHub tasks where required
- Own and execute events that are targeted to the Kubernetes contributor community, including:
  - ICON community meetings, including in-person and virtual
  - Cryptocurrency industry conferences
  - Retrospective moderation for other SIGs upon request
  - Other events, like other SIG face to face events, upon request and consideration
- Strategize, build, and execute on scalable mentoring programs for all contributor levels. These may include:
  - Meet Our Contributors
  - Group Mentoring
- Help onboard new and current contributors into the culture, workflow, and CI of our contributor experience through the [contributor guide](../../guidelines/contribution/contribution-guide.md), other related documentation, [contributor summits] and programs tailored to onboarding.
- Perform issue triage on and maintain the [icon-project/community](https://github.com/icon-project/community) repository.  
- Help SIGs with being as transparent and open as possible through creating best practices, guidelines, and general administration of YouTube, Discord, and our mailing lists where applicable
- Assist SIGs/WG Chairs and Technical Leads with organizational management operations as laid out in the [sig-governance](../../guidelines/governance/sig-governance-guidelines.md) doc
- Distribute contributor related news on various ICON ecosystem channels, including collaborating with the communications team for posting blogs, social media, and other media as needed.
- Establish and share metrics to measure project health, community health, and general trends, including:
  - the contributor experience survey(s)
  - engagement on project platforms that we manage
- Research other OSS projects and consult with their leaders about contributor experience topics to make sure we are always delivering value to our contributors

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

We cross-cut all SIGs and WGs to deliver the following processes:

- Deploying Changes:
  When implementing policy changes we strive to balance responding quickly to the needs of the community and ensuring a disruption-free experience for project contributors. As such, the amount of notice we provide and the amount of consensus we seek is driven by our estimation of risk. We don't measure risk objectively at this time, but estimate it based on these parameters:
  - Low-risk changes impact a small number (<4) of SIGs, WGs, or repos, do not break existing contributor workflows, and are easy to roll back. When implementing low-risk changes we:
    - Socialize on [ICON Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm) and our update calls
    - We will go to each lead, their mailing lists, slack channel, and/or their update meetings and ask for feedback and a [lazy consensus] process. We will follow up with a post to [ICON Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm) `#dev_announcements` channel
  - High-risk changes impact a large number (>4) of SIGs, WGs, or repos, break existing contributor workflows, and are not easy to roll back. When implementing high-risk changes we:
    - Socialize on [ICON Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm) and our update calls
    - Seek [lazy consensus] with a time box of at least 72 business hours with a GitHub issue link (or proposal if not applicable) to the following communication channels:
      - [ICON Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm) `#dev_announcements` channel
      - We will also announce it at an ICON Community Meeting
- Depending on how wide of an ecosystem change this is, we may also discord message, blog, tweet, and use other channels to get the word out.
- Our standard time box is 72 business hours; however, there may be situations where we need to act quickly but the time period will always be clear and upfront.
- Encourage automation to improve productivity for contributors where it makes sense and consult with SIG Testing if automation is covering GitHub workflows.

### Out of scope

- Code for the testing and CI infrastructure - that’s SIG Testing
- [icon-project/iips](https://github.com/icon-project/iips) ownership of proposals. This is managed by the [Technical Steering Committee](../../committees/steering-committee/).
- User community management. Outside of contributors, the Communications Team manages the user community
- We do not create SIGs/WGs/UGs but can assist in the various community management needs of their micro communities that would kick off their formation and keep them going.
- We are not the [code of conduct committee] and therefore do not control incident management reporting or decisions; however, our moderation guidelines allow us to act swiftly if there is a clear violation of terms of either our code of conduct or one of our supported platforms terms of service. If there is an action that the committee needs to take that involves one of these platforms (example: the removal of someone from GitHub), we will carry that out if none of the committee members have access.
- Communication platforms that are out of our scope for maintenance and support but we may still have some influence:
    - [r/helloicon](https://www.reddit.com/r/helloicon)
    - [@helloiconworld](https://twitter.com/helloiconworld) twitter account
